<h1>Topic: How Javascript works and Execution Context</h1></br>
<h2> "Everything in javascript happens inside the execution context"</h2></br></br>
<h3><b>Execution Context</b></h3></br>
<p><b>Execution Context</b> is like a big box which has two components:</p></br>
<p><b>1. Memory component</b></p></br>
<p>This is the place where all the variables and functions are stored in key value pair.</p></br>
<p>Example: a: 10, fn: {}</p></br>
<p>This component has a word known as variable environment.</p></br>
<p><b>2. Code Component</b></p></br>
This is the place where the code is executed one line at a time.
It is also known an thread of execution.
</br></br>

<h2>"Javascript is a synchronous single-threaded language"</h2></br></br>
<p> Single Threaded:- JS can only execute one command at a time.</p>
<p> Synchronous Single Threaded:- JS can only execute one command at a time in a specific order. i.e. It can go to the other line once it has executed the current line.</p>
